# PreCourse

Welcome to the Computational Social Science pre course!

The purpose of this course is for students to develop foundational skills in the Python programming language. 

The course is primarily self-study. While the amount of material covered here is relatively low, we expect that students will have a strong working knowledge of the concepts covered. This may require multiple passes through the videos and associated assignments.

## Outline

The outline for the course follows the structure and order of the video lectures and is as follows:

1. Big Picture
2. Installation
3. Python Introduction
4. Python Collections
5. Control Flow
6. Python Functions
7. Python Classes (object oriented programming)
8. Project: Farkle dice game introduction
9. Project: Using git to manage farkle code
10. Project: Code style with farkle project
11. Project: Code testing in farkle project

The resources used when creating the videos can be found in the `resources` folder. This includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks. 

Within the `resources` folder there will be sub-folders on a per-video basis. Please use these resources as you study the videos.
